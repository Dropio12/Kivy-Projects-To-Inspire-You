![App UI Image](/data/cover.png "Plant Care App UI")
Description
-------------
This is a **frontend only** implementation of an indoor plant care app created as a marathon using [Python](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjht53auM32AhWwQEEAHflhBMQQFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw0QREvGsjwHKp2GtoYvs1JH) and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)

The app was designed by me using the free online Figma app

How to run
-----------
Assuming you already have python and pip installed, simply: 

* Install the requirements, preferably in a virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Then run main.py preferably with device-like dimensions
```
python main.py --size=300x640
```
